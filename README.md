## Model C4

## First step is a BigPicture
I used three first phases from EventStorming BigPicture to create a model of Cinema.

To create Model C4 diagrams I did not need a whole and detailed model with all events ;)

But after this step. I can saw some components for C1 System Context.
That's are Events as my Cinema Domain, Actors as Persons, and External Systems.

And now I can show the first layer of C4 Model.

Of course, the legend is necessary.
